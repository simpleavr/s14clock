# S14Clock

[Install v2.04 beta firmware, pick firmware beta](https://simpleavr.github.io/s14clock/install.html)

**2025-01-05** Fix hardware version detection, V2-24 hardware detection was broken.

**2024-05-02** Change 'alternate transition' token from '\~=' to '\~!'. '\~=' be used in new "exact date" macro, '\~=0501?HAPPY MAYDAY'. Implement alternate transition for "flip" to flip also spaces.  Implement alternate transition for "flash" to use alternate sequence.

**2023-12-10** Implements "alternate transition"" macro, `'\~='`. I.e. double-blink for **Blink** transition, left-to-right for **Shift** and **Drip** transitions, and alternate sequence for other transitions.

**2023-12-07** Implements "day counting" macro, `'\~<MMDD? DAYS TO ..'` and `'\~>MMDD? DAYS SINCE ..'`, apart from MMDD, YYMMDD and YYYYMMDD also accepted. Capable of counting up to 40+ years due to datatype constraint. When using MMDD, system assumes past, current, or next year as reference automatically.

**2023-11-27** NTP server and POSIX TZ configuration changed from using 8th content slot to a new storage space. The new fields are 40 characters wide and
should be able to hold the extra long TZ strings.

**2023-11-08** V2.03 Add optional POSIX TZ configuration support. This will allow daylight saving time configurations (eg. EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0).  Enter POSIX TZ string as the 8th "Additional Content" text, prefixed with '@' character, and make sure the "Use" checkbox is off. Example enter "@EST5EDT" as the 8th display addn text. Configuration web page will now also detect geo-location and suggest a proper TZ value to use. Feature available in bin/firmware_203.bin

**2023-07-25** Implement new content tokens `'\~+dd'` and `'\~-dd'` to adjust current time by adding / subtracting hours, useful for multi-city display.

**2023-06-25** Implement configurable NTP server, to configure, enter overriding NTP server url as the 8th "Display Content" text, prefixed with '@' character, and make sure the "Use" checkbox is off. Example enter "@time2.google.com" as the 8th display content text.

**2023-06-12** Added to main branch are 2 startup options, press-n-hold button '0' during "0000..." test screen allow resetting WIFI credentials, pressing button '0' during "FW... HW.." version display enters Burn-In mode without setup, which excercise the time showing routines without WIFI.

**2023-06-07** V2.02 common firmware auto-detects and support all (V3, V2-24, V2-12) hardware designs. V3 hardware design eliminates 74HC154 4-to-16 line decoder. V2.02 software adds charliplexing to V2.01 led multiplexing scheme and achieves 14 x 24 (336 segments) direct driving with 26 IO pins.

S14Clock is a bar shaped, web synchronized word clock featuring 24 or 12 characters, 14 segment display.

Build using Arduino or PlatformIO.

S14Clock relies on Arduino AutoConnect library by Hieromon.
If using Arduino to build, make sure you install the library first.

[Download as **.zip**](https://github.com/simpleavr/s14clock/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/simpleavr/s14clock.git`

## Building using Arduino

- Open the folder `s14clock_firmware`, double click `s14clock_firmware.ino` and it will open in the Arduino IDE
- if you don't yet have support for ESP32 follow [the instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html) to install the platform
- go to Library Manager, search for "AutoConnect" and install the resulting library by "Hieromon Ikasamo"
- select the board ESP32 > ESP32S2 Dev Module 
- select the port it is connected to
- press Verify
- if it verifies correctly press Upload

## Building with PlatformIO

- ~~edit src/main.cpp to include "ver2.h" (12 characters version) or "ver2l.h" (24 characters version)~~
- cd s14clock
- pio project init --board lolin_s2_mini
- pio lib install AutoConnect
- pio run --target upload

Once installed, follow the guide hosted at the [project description](https://simpleavr.github.io/s14clock/index.html)

V2.01 firmware (2023-03-20)

- replace "glow" transition with "drip" transition
- enchange shift transition

V2.02 firmware (2023-05-29)

- introduce "flash" transition
- add option to cycle through all transaction modes one after another
- config time with new time zone immediately after change
- autodetect v2, v2l, v3 hardware
- substitute underscore with space for ad-hoc messages
- ad-hoc messages now follows transition in
- implements %-[dmHIMSjuW] tokens in strftime() to suppress leading zeros and spaces

V2.03 firmware (2023-11-27)

- implement new content tokens '\~+dd' and '\~-dd' to adjust current time, useful for multi-city display.
- allows NTP server override and POSIX TZ support, allowing standard and daylight saving time switching.
